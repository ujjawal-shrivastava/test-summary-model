##Project URL

####https://summarizer.vercel.app
<br>
##Background
<hr>We developed this project for the [HackNagpur](https://hacknagpur.tech "HackNagpur") hackathon. We chose education as our track for the project and started brainstorming about little problems that we face as students. One such problem was reading complete pages and boring texts and feeding irrelevant and repetitive data to our brain. So we decided to build a text summarizer of our own that will leverage latest AI models to summarize text and on top of that we also decided to add term refining feature.
